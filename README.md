# OS_A3
Implementing Malloc(), Realloc() and free(). Given blueprint of the the code. 

We have created all the functions named my_malloc(), my_calloc() and my_free() in the my_mmu.h file. Hence, to use them we need to import them by adding a header " #include "my_mmu.h" ". After this, we can just call the functions above and test/work with them.
